# curve-fitted-segmentation
In segmentation, the current state-of-the-art model generates contours that are hard and inefficient to edit, and in the form that conveys little geometric information about the shape and contour. To further improve on the outputs from segmentation model, this project looks at an application that performs curve-fitting on the contour generated by the model. The final output of the curve fitting is a centripetal-parameterized Catmull-Rom spline, which enables easy editing and provides useful information regarding the shape of interest.
